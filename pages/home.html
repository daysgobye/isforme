<h2>So whats is this site?</h2>
This site started as a chat-app to chat with your self. You simply go to a new URL claim it and your ready to chat with
your self.
We have all sent that random text to a friend of a phone number or password. just because we needed to save it for a
bit.
Or your on a new phone havent installed anything yet and you need a way to get a peice of text to your new device.
Sence then I have been using it and found it to be a helpful tool for all sorts of things like:
<ul>
    <li>sharing a group of links instead of spamming a friend with 10 links just share one space link that you genarated
        just for this and forget about it after you no longer need it.</li>
    <li>Quick on boarding to new project. list all the requerments and what people need to bring with no need for
        accounts or emails.</li>
    <li>Idea board / colloage space.</li>
    <li>Free link tree with so much more custmization</li>
</ul>

So many google docs are made for just one use and you always need to set the promessions and have so much hassle that is
not needed for most things.
Here you can set a read or write password only if needed but for a quick throwaway who cares.
